**Assignment 2:**.


### Using the repository

  1. Fork the repository. Use the *fork* icon on the top of the page
     to do so. You will find that the forked repository has a name similar to
     the main one, except that it starts with your student id.

  2. Clone the repository so that you get a local copy.  You might need to
     install git on your machine, especially if you are using Windows as your
     OS. Look at the assignment page for instructions.

  3. Work on your local copy.  Commit your work regularly.  Push your work
     to the your forked repository regularly.

  4. *DO NOT* add any of your tutors as members in your repo.

  5. There will be a default user called comp2420-2019-marker.  *DO NOT* remove this user. 

### Working from home

Please be mindful of the notes within the notebook file which specify how to
connect to the database when in the CSIT labs. You have been provided the database
information in a csv format to work on the later questions outside of the lab,
but to receive marks for Section 2 you must not use these csvs in the final
submission.

You are also welcome to setup the database at home if you desire to test your work. The database information can be found [here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).


[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) is used in the CSIT labs and for this assignment. [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/download/) is used for the python connection.
